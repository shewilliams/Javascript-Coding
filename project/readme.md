# Meteorites!
<section>This is a project about meteorite landings throughout the world. The data includes the following: name, id, nametype, recclass (material of meteorite), mass (in g), fall (recorded as fell or founded), year (recorded), reclat, reclong. The dataset will be cleaned up to remove any rows with blank and zero values. This is also to make sure the webpage doesn't load slowly due to the large dataset (original has over 30k rows).


The data will feature meteorites that weigh, at and over, 10kg (~20lbs).  [Convert CSV](https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm) will be used to convert the data from CSV to GeoJSON.
