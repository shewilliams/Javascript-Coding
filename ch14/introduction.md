## Introduction

This is the introduction to a web project based on the five African-American
urban communities mentioned in [Langston
Hughes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes)’s poem “Could Be.” Alba
Newmann Holmes introduced me to this poem when presenting a paper, “‘Could
Be’: Langston Hughes as Situationist Cartographer,” at a special session I
convened at the [MLA Convention in
2015](https://moacir.com/talks/mla-15-geocritical-explorations-inside-the-text/).
